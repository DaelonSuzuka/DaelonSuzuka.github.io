This is an overview of some of the projects I've been working on lately.

## Stagehand

[Stagehand](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/Stagehand) is a desktop application that helps to automate your [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) workflow.

Can interface with USB-connected physical controls like button pads or foot switches using the JUDI protocol.

## EasyXC8

[EasyXC8](https://github.com/DaelonSuzuka/Easy-XC8) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing embedded projects using Microchip's XC8 compiler. 

## Chitin

A tiny shell designed to fit in very small embedded systems.

Features:
- good escape sequence support
- good line editing 

A live demo is sometimes available [on my website](http://chitin.daelon.net).

## QtStrap

[QtStrap](https://github.com/qtstrap/qtstrap) is a python library to get your PySide2/PyQt5 applications up and running quickly.

It comes with prebuilt solutions to many potentially frustrating Python/Qt issues.

QtStrap also has a decent(and growing!) selection of custom widgets with advanced behavior.

## JUDI

[JUDI](https://github.com/Codex-Engine/JUDI) is a basic framework for developing serial communication protocols to connect embedded devices to computers(or each other).

## Codex 

Codex is a serial device protocol abstraction layer designed to standardize communcations with different types of serial devices.

The [reference implementation of Codex](https://github.com/Codex-Engine/codex-engine-pyqt) is written in python, and built for PySide2/QyQt applications, but non-Qt and non-python implementations shouldn't be difficult.
