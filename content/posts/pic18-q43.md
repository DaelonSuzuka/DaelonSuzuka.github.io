I enjoy using Microchip PIC18s, most recently the [Q43 Family](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/8-bit-mcus/pic-mcus/pic18-q43). The one I use most is the [PIC18F57Q43](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC18F57Q43). 

Here's a little comparison of the specs:
