I now have three development machines: a desktop, a Surface Pro 5, and a mid-2012 Macbook Pro. All three are running Windows 10 Pro, and I have at least one WSL installation on each machine. That's a minimum of six keys.
Each of those keys needs to be usable on at least a dozen target machines: a VPS, a couple industrial automation machines, a home server, a mess of raspberry pis, and more I can't remember.</description></item><item><title>Care and Feeding of a mid-2012 MacBook Pro</title><link>https://daelon.net/posts/mbp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 13:52:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/posts/mbp/</guid><description>A friend recently gave me his old mid-2012 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro. He has a newer MacBook Air now, and no longer needed his older Pro. He warned me that it had become exceedingly slow, but otherwise had no problems.
For the past several years, my primary machines have been a desktop and a Surface Pro 5. While the Surface is great, and I recommend it if you have any use at all for a pen (drawing, OneNote, whiteboarding), it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a tablet and not a laptop.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://daelon.net/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:28:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/about/</guid><description>this is an about page

After years of waffling and procrastination, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to put together a blog platform that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like chewing on broken glass. Hugo seems to strike a good balance between flexible, powerful, simple, and extensible.
One less excuse to avoid putting thought to pixel.</description></item></channel></rss>
