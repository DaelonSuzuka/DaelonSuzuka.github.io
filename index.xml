Git branches are just a fact of life if you work on projects above a certain size: there&amp;rsquo;s just no other (good) way to scale and coordinate effort from multiple programmers on one codebase. Unfortunately, mandatory doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean always mean pleasant, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you have danced the Branch Shuffle enough times that you know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.

Let&amp;rsquo;s explore:
Consider the following snippet, that creates a dialog box, a vertical box layout, and a Label and ProgressBar.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 var update_dialog = AcceptDialog.new() var vbox = VBoxContainer.new() update_dialog.add_child(vbox) var status_label = Label.new() vbox.add_child(status_label) var progress_bar = ProgressBar.new() vbox.add_child(progress_bar) This is unpleasant for a number of reasons, but the most important one is that you can&amp;rsquo;t just read it from top to bottom.</description></item><item><title>Godot Editor Settings and You: An Exercise in Pain Reduction</title><link>https://daelon.net/posts/godot_editor_settings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 22:21:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/posts/godot_editor_settings/</guid><description>The Godot editor has a number of absolutely boneheaded default settings. Here&amp;rsquo;s my recommendations for a better overall experience:
Step one: Use an external text editor
This just saves space:
interface/inspector/horizontal_vector2_editing = true I often work on plugins, which means restarting the editor all time. This makes restarting suck less.
interface/scene_tabs/restore_scenes_on_load = true These prevent the internal script editor from building a collection of every single script in your project:</description></item><item><title>Adventures in VSCode Extensions</title><link>https://daelon.net/posts/vscode_extensions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 19:59:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/posts/vscode_extensions/</guid><description>The scope tags (&amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo;) applied by a match are actually a space-separated list of tags. Multiple tags can be added by a single rule. This fact can be used for debugging by adding extra tags to a rule to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s being applied properly.

When working on embedded systems, especially starting a new project, there&amp;rsquo;s so many things to do that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed by decision paralysis. Imagine you just got the first prototype of a new board. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any code for it yet. Where do you start?

Each one has a keypair. There are 10 remote hosts that I want to SSH into from any of the dev machines. Password authentication is disabled. I do not have physical access to all of the remote hosts. I have created a 3rd dev machine, and I need to be able to SSH into any of hosts.
Solution #1: get on one of the original dev machines SSH into the a remote host enable password auth go back to the new dev machine run ssh-copy-id &amp;lt;remote host&amp;gt; go back to original dev machine disable password auth repeat for every remote host This is terrible.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://daelon.net/links/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 11:32:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/links/</guid><description>Things that I think are worth sharing.

He has a newer MacBook Air now, and no longer needed his older Pro. He warned me that it had become exceedingly slow, but otherwise had no problems.
For the past several years, my primary machines have been a desktop and a Surface Pro 5. While the Surface is great, and I recommend it if you have any use at all for a pen (drawing, OneNote, whiteboarding), it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a tablet and not a laptop.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://daelon.net/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:28:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/about/</guid><description>this is an about page

After years of waffling and procrastination, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to put together a blog platform that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like chewing on broken glass. Hugo seems to strike a good balance between flexible, powerful, simple, and extensible.
One less excuse to avoid putting thought to pixel.</description></item></channel></rss>
