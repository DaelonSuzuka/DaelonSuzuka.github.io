When working on embedded systems, especially starting a new project, there&amp;rsquo;s so many things to do that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed by decision paralysis. Imagine you just got the first prototype of a new board. You don&amp;rsquo;t have any code for it yet. Where do you start?

Each one has a keypair. There are 10 remote hosts that I want to SSH into from any of the dev machines. Password authentication is disabled. I do not have physical access to all of the remote hosts. I have created a 3rd dev machine, and I need to be able to SSH into any of hosts.
Solution #1: get on one of the original dev machines SSH into the a remote host enable password auth go back to the new dev machine run ssh-copy-id &amp;lt;remote host&amp;gt; go back to original dev machine disable password auth repeat for every remote host This is terrible.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://daelon.net/links/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 11:32:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/links/</guid><description>Things that I think are worth sharing.

He has a newer MacBook Air now, and no longer needed his older Pro. He warned me that it had become exceedingly slow, but otherwise had no problems.
For the past several years, my primary machines have been a desktop and a Surface Pro 5. While the Surface is great, and I recommend it if you have any use at all for a pen (drawing, OneNote, whiteboarding), it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a tablet and not a laptop.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://daelon.net/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:28:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daelon.net/about/</guid><description>this is an about page

After years of waffling and procrastination, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to put together a blog platform that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like chewing on broken glass. Hugo seems to strike a good balance between flexible, powerful, simple, and extensible.
One less excuse to avoid putting thought to pixel.</description></item></channel></rss>
